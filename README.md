   title: Big Data Platforms as a Service
   abstract: >
      Big Data platform solutions allow data producers to use data to the fullest
      potential by combining processing engines with storage solutions and analytic 
      technologies. Pharmaceutical clients are looking into platform solutions to 
      safely store, analyze, and use clinical trial data, experimental data, drug 
      development studies, drug production, regulation, and a number of other outlets. 
      Just a few of the benefits of using a platform solution to manage these data 
      outlets are not having to change current work processes, that management and 
      other research groups can access and use data without needing special access to 
      systems, and scaleability of storage and analytic components is seamless. The 
      problems faced to implementing big data platform solutions include the selection 
      of a platform vendor, the design of appropriate data architecture, and establishing
      effective user interfaces.
