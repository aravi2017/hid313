        Big Data platform solutions allow data producers to use data to the
        fullest potential by combining processing engines with storage solutions and
        analytic  technologies. Pharmaceutical clients are looking into platform solutions
        to  safely store, analyze, and use clinical trial data, experimental data,
        drug  development studies, drug production, regulation, and a number of other
        outlets.  Just a few of the benefits of using a platform solution to manage
        these data  outlets are not having to change current work processes, that
        management and  other research groups can access and use data without needing
        special access to  systems, and scaleability of storage and analytic components
        is seamless. The  problems faced to implementing big data platform solutions
        include the selection  of a platform vendor, the design of appropriate data
        architecture, and establishing effective user interfaces.
