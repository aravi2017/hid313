    "While many relate stock market trading to gambling, successful traders have turned stock picking into a science. The likes of Warren Buffet tell us that successful stock buying is all in the research. So what kind of research aids in the prediction of companies within the highly volatile pharmaceutical market? The use of available, open-source APIs and Google Alerts are used to explore if clinical trial results can directly impact stock performance in small, mid, and large cap pharmaceutical companies. Key words and/or phrases in results and related news articles are identified as possible predictors of market effect. As well as a comparison to already established analyst ratings from Barclays, Goldman, Morningstar, or others which have already been shown to impact stock performance."
