\begin{abstract}
While many relate stock market trading to gambling, successful traders have turned stock picking into a science. The likes of Warren Buffet tell us that successful stock buying is all in the research. So what kind of research aids in the prediction of companies within the highly volatile pharmaceutical market? The use of available, open-source APIs and Google Alerts are used to explore if clinical trial results can directly impact stock performance in small, mid, and large cap pharmaceutical companies. Key words and/or phrases in results and related news articles are identified as possible predictors of market effect. As well as a comparison to already established analyst ratings from Barclays, Goldman, Morningstar, or others which have already been shown to impact stock performance.

The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) began as an all-electric equities exchange in 1971 and today provides trading, technology, and information services for financial markets  \cite{www-nasdaq}. NASDAQ's website provides historical stock performance data that can be exported as a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file. The disadvantage of NASDAQ's free export service is that each stock must be exported separately. The free quote service can be accessed at http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/. NASDAQ provides API services for subscribers starting at \$5,000 per year \cite{www-nasdaq-sub}. Access to NASDAQ's API services can also be granted through corporate sponsorship. NASDAQ's free CSV export services were used to collect initial project data. In example, the stock history for Celsion Corporation during the week of August 21, 2017 is shown.
